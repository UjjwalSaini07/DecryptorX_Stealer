## 1. FakeSSID:

#### **About this project**
- WiFi captive portal for the NodeMCU (ESP8266 Module) with DNS spoofing.
- The built-in LED will blink 5 times when a password is posted.

<b>Warning!</b> Your saved passwords will **not** disappear when you restart/power off the ESP8266.

<b>Note:</b> If you want to see the stored passwords go to "**172.0.0.1**<a>/pass</a>". For changing the SSID, go to "**172.0.0.1**<a>/ssid</a>"

**HackPoints:**

    <th>172.0.0.1/index</th>

    <th>172.0.0.1/pass</th>
    <th>172.0.0.1/ssid</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This is the main page. Here the user will write his password and send it.</td>
    <td>This is the post page. The user will be redirected here after posting the password.</td>
    <td>This is where the attacker can retrieve all the passwords that has been posted.</td>
    <td>Here the attacker can change the SSID name of the Access Point on the go.</td>
